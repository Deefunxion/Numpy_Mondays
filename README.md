# Mondays: Prompt Cognitive Scaffolding Project

Welcome to the **Numpy_Mondays** project â€” an experimental initiative blending prompt engineering, cognitive heuristics, and legal-diagnostic reasoning under a unified prompt-based architecture.

## ðŸ§  Purpose
To explore how large language models can be transformed into domain-aware agents using structured prompt layers, curated legal corpora, and embedded heuristics.

## ðŸ”§ Structure
This repository includes:
- `scaffolds/` â€” curated `.md` files used as context layers (e.g., legal logic, medical agents, administrative discretion)
- `illustrations/` â€” real-world conversational examples showing agent behavior
- `manifest.md` â€” a high-level architectural overview without full model disclosure
- `LICENSE` â€” to be selected once evaluation phase completes

## ðŸš« Controlled Access
This repo offers **only selective visibility** into the full Mondays stack. Some components (e.g., embedding architecture, chain-of-thought orchestration) remain private until stability and audit readiness are confirmed.

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy
> This space is not a container. It is a forge.  
> â€” _from the Codex of the Mondays_
